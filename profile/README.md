## Get to know us! 👋
The "Dario Nobili" Library of the CNR Research Area of Bologna offers services to support the scientific research of the CNR institutes present in Bologna and their branches (about 900 researchers) and hosts collections covering all disciplines of the hard sciences. Since 2000, the library has been a reference point in the development of services in the field of digital resource sharing:

- RSCVD (Resource Sharing during COVID-19), born under the aegis of IFLA, is the first experience of free digital resource sharing worldwide.
- NILDE (Network for Inter-Library Document Exchange) is currently used by over 850 libraries and 90,000 end users, with about 3 million document exchanges in 15 years.
